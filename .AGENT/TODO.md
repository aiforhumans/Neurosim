# NeuroSim AI Companion - Development TODO

## üö® Critical Priority - Fix Immediately

### Deprecation Warnings (Urgent)
- [x] **Fix Chroma import deprecation** - Migrate from `langchain_community.vectorstores.Chroma` to `langchain-chroma` package
  - File: `neurosim/agents/memory_agent.py:66`
  - Action: `pip install -U langchain-chroma` and update import
  - Impact: Will break in LangChain 1.0
  - **COMPLETED**: Updated import to use `langchain_chroma.Chroma`
- [x] **Fix LLMChain deprecation** - Replace with RunnableSequence pattern
  - File: `neurosim/agents/reasoning_agent.py:46`
  - Replace `LLMChain(llm=self.llm, prompt=self.prompt)` with `prompt | llm`
  - Impact: Will break in LangChain 1.0
  - **COMPLETED**: Updated to use `self.prompt | self.llm` pattern
- [x] **Fix Gradio Chatbot deprecation** - Set `type='messages'` parameter
  - File: `neurosim/interface/ui.py:54` 
  - Change: `gr.Chatbot([], label="Conversation", type='messages')`
