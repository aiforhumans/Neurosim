"""
Agent package for NeuroSim.

This subpackage contains concrete implementations for the various
behavioural components of the system. Each agent is responsible for
encapsulating a specific concern, such as memory storage, emotional
state management or conversation handling. Agents are wired together
via the :class:`neurosim.core.agent_manager.AgentManager`.
